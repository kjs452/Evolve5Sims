Description: Second
A new simulation with a couple transplanted organisms
with 100,000 units of energy each.

I copied an organism that has been
evolving over night. The organism was from the
"shooter + backward radiator" type of organism.

	mar37cm.txt			is a starting simulation file.

	mar38.txt			is a starting simulation file.
						has 4 creatures transplantes from
						another long term simulation.

	mar38n.txt			transplant from a long term sim, march 8
	mar39.txt			transplant from a long term sim, march 9
	mar310.txt			transplant from a long term sim, march 10

Just load the files and run them.

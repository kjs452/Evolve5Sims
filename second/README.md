Description: Second
A new simulation with a couple transplanted organisms
with 100,000 units of energy each.

I copied an organism that has been
evolving over night. The organism was from the
"shooter + backward radiator" type of organism.

	mar37cm.txt			is a starting simulation file.

Just load the file and run it.

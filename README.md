Evolve 5.0 Simulations and Seed Files

This repostitory will contain simulation files which can be read into Evolve 5.0.

If the file extension is .kf it is a kforth seed program.

If the filename extension is .txt it is a complete simulation file.

If the filename is seed_XXXXX.kf it indicates an initial seed program, which is developer friendly with comments
labels and such.

If the filename is dna_XXXXX.kf it indicates a saved, evolved DNA program, this will be helpful because the header
comment includes the exact simulation properties used.

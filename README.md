Evolve 5.0 Simulations and Seed Files

This repostitory will contain simulation files which can be read into Evolve 5.0.

If the file extension is .kf it is a kforth seed program.

If the filename extension is .txt it is a complete simulation file.

If the filename is seed_XXXXX.kf it indicates an initial seed program, which is developer friendly with comments
labels and such.

If the filename is dna_XXXXX.kf it indicates a saved, evolved DNA program, this will be helpful because the header
comment includes the exact simulation properties used.

```
dumsim          Just a standard simulation with normal 'Default' properties
first           Demonstrates a "bullet with energy radiating backward toward the shooter"
hanoi           a pre-built simulation file with the towers of hanoi simulation ready to go.
laplace         First attempts at a maxwell's daemon simulaton, entropy, brownian motion
odor_eater      A new instuction added 'TRAP9' which can take energy from another cell
second          A long term simulation with a couple transplanted organisms with 100,000 units of energy each.
simzoo          Assortment of starting simulations, which various properties
tank            The EVOLVING TANK. It is based on the user tank.
uni             another basic simulation I am running over a long period of time, has interrupts enabled
utank           The user tank activity, simulation file ready to go.

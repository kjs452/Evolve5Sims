Description: dumsim
	Just a standard simulation with normal 'Default' properties.

	The simulation is: 800x800, oval with hand drawn barriers.
		One Strain based off of 'Default'. Non-agressive eat mode.
		No interrupts are being used. Lots of energy. High population.
		The organisms begin with the standard seed program seed.kf.

	dumsim0.txt				very beginning before any steps executed., start march 11, 2023
	dumsim_mar11.txt.Z		after several hours. Compressed. march 11.

	dumsim_mar12.txt.Z		march 12, it got boring so i added a nibbler strain.

	dumsim_mar13.txt.Z		march 13, not boring anymore, nibllers made things interesting
	dumsim_mar13_transplants.txt.Z		small simulation. transplant of 1 creature from the mar 13 simulation.

	dumsim_mar14.txt.Z		march 14, its getting boring
	dumsim_mar14_transplants.txt.Z		small simulation. transplant of 1 creature from the mar 14 simulation.

	dumsim_mar15.txt.Z		march 15, still boring
	dumsim_mar15_transplants.txt.Z		small simulation. transplant of 1 creature from the mar 15 simulation.

	super_nibbler.kf		seed program to implement a nibbler that radiates
							energy to the farthest thing.

I will upload a new simulation daily, until the sim gets boring.

Given the big universe and high population, it makes sense to
play with a small subset of the universe once you download it.
Use cut/paste to move organisms to a blank simulation, then
tweak energy to a smaller amount so that the population isn't too
high.

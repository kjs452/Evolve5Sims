Description: Odor Eater
	A wierd idea for a simulation. A new instuvction added 'TRAP9' which
	can take energy from another cell. The amount of energy taken is proprotional
	to the guess of the odor value the other cell is sitting on.

	energy_odor_taker.kf			- the seed program, its a standard seed but with
	OdorEater.txt					- a prebuilt simulation with the strains setup

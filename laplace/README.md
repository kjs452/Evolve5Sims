Description: laplace
	* Explore Entropy
	* Brownian motion
	* First attempts at a maxwell's daemon simulaton

The creatures
	brownian.kf			move randomly
	brownian2i.kf		move randomly respond to interrupts
	brownian_spell.kf	move randomly respond, when space key pressed spell a word
	gatekeeper.kf		SAY's a message downard when space key pressed.

	maxwell.kf			Moves around randomly. When space key pressed converges to a specific point

	laplace1.txt		simulation showing a laplace's deamon kind of experiment
	laplace2.txt		simulation showing a laplace's deamon kind of experiment

	statue_maxwell.txt	simulation showing all particles converge on a common
							location when space key pressed. Like gas molecules
							organizing themselves into the corner of the room.

	bigbang.txt			same as statue_maxwell.txt, except i got all the blocks clumped together
						by the creative use of space key.

Press SPACE key to trigger the gate keeper

Just load the files and run them.
